ZPT - Zope Page Template Renderer

This module contains a plasTeX renderer that uses Zope Page Templates
(actually simpleTAL) as the templating engine.

NOTE: This module isn't really needed any more.  The PageTempate 
renderer does everything that this module did and more.  This is 
just here for backwards compatibility.
